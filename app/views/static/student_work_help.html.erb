    <h2>Student Works Help</h2>

    <p>
      <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %> was developed to store and share the scholarly output and creative works of UC faculty (current and emeritus), staff, and students. Works that are deposited in <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %> should support the mission of the University of Cincinnati. Students should work with a faculty member to share scholarly output and creative works, such a capstone projects. <b>All official theses and dissertations must be submitted directly to the Graduate School and not <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>.</b>

      There are two main workflows for submitting student works to <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>: Self-Submission and Indirect Submission.

      Self-Submission of Student Works is the preferred method of submitting student works.

    <ul>
      <li><%= link_to "Guidelines for Faculty", advisor_guidelines_path %></li>
      <li><%= link_to "Instructions for Students", student_instructions_path %></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Indirect submissions are when students submit first to a system other than <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>, such as <a href="https://canopy.uc.edu" target="_blank">Canopy</a>. Direct, self-submission is preferred as it allows students, in <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>, to agree to the non-exclusive distribution license and to select their own licensing terms for reuse (Creative Commons). In some cases indirect submissions are necessary, and in that case please contact <%= link_to t('hyrax.product_name'), hyrax.contact_path %> for additional help.
